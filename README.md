pacman
======

pacman is an attempt to create a set of pure [Go][go] packages that allow
interaction with the Arch Linux package manager, [Pacman][pacman], and the
various services associated with it, such as the [AUR][aur]. Pacman
related tools that use these packages, such as an AUR helper, are
planned as well.
